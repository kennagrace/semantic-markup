        <p>This page is going to contain testimonies of Jesus Christ. I'm still working on the details, but for now the following topics are the plan.</p>
        <h2>Premortal</h2>
        <p>This section will include testimonies of the Savior in the premortal life.</p>
        <h3>Scriptures</h3>
        <p>This section is special in that we have a <em>significant</em> number of written testimonies of people who knew him during his lifetme.</p>
        <h2>Mortal Ministry</h2>
        <p>This will be full of testimonies of His mortal ministry.</p>
        <h2>Resurrected</h2>
        <p>Just like the others, this section/page will have testimonies of the resurrected Christ.</p>
